# avalanches and sorciere

In this folder we collected all the code used to obtain the results of the manuscript: Neri, M., Runfola, C., te Rietmolen, N. A., Sorrentino, P., Schon, D., Morillon, B., & Rabuffo, G. (2023). Neuronal Avalanches in Naturalistic Speech and Music Listening. bioRxiv, 2023-12.

In the python files (.py), it is possible to find all the functions that we used to analyse the data. In the notebooks (.ipynb), it is possible to see how we used the functions to obtain and plot the main results of our work. 

Comments and requests should be addressed to Matteo Neri, Benjamin Morillon and Giovanni Rabuffo: matteo.neri@etu.univ-amu.fr; giovanni.rabuffo@univ-amu.fr; bnmorillon@gmail.com.
